## Welcome to the Candy Store!

The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate your knowledge and application of Java fundamentals. 

## Program Specifications

You will write a program that serves customers different kinds of candy. The list of candy and the prices is as follows:

a) Reese's Pieces: $2.50/0.5 kg

b) Skittles: $1.75/1 kg

c) Jubjubes: $0.50/1 kg

d) Lollipops: 1 for $0.50 or 5 for $2.00

e) Smarties: $1.50/1 kg

Write a program that prompts the user (a customer) to select a type of candy and quantity. Your program should continuously ask the customer what type of candy and the quantity to purchase until the customer enters "quit" for the type of candy.

At the end of the program, you should print out the customer's receipt by calculating the total cost before and after tax. (Tax is charged at 13%).

You have been provided with some starter code (CandyShop.java) to help you organize your program. These methods must be completed and called in the main method of the program for full marks. You must also document your code with appropriate comments throughout the program. For this assignment, **no error checking is necessary**. However, you may choose to include it.
